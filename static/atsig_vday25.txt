Dear Atsi (small),

I wanted to start off by saying just how happy I am that you are my valentine.
I'm so happy to have been with you for our second year as Valentines. You are my 
one and only love, which I do not take for granted or lightly. I look forward
to many many many Valentine's days to come my love.

With lots and lots and lots of love (and a bunch (and more)),
Sahej
